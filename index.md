# The Jack Rawlings Blog

**This is the beginning of my blogging journey. I've been thinking about it for a while so thought... why the hell not?**

# Why should you stick around?
I want to provide potential readers with viewpoints and perspectives that are different and intrespectively developed. Since I was 16 I have kept a journal and developed a reflective practive that helps me be successful.

Everyone has a different definition of what success means to them, if you take one thing away from this blog that takes you a step closer to *your success* then this whole process is worth it.

One thing I'll look to explore aswell... what is success? Is it important? And who gives a shit?
